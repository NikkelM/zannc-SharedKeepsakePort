# Shared Keepsake Port

A mod which ports over Sisyphus, Eurydice, Patroclus and Thanatos from Hades 1 into Hades 2. \
Although released as a standalone mod - its primary function is to be used as a dependency for [Zagreus' Journey](https://thunderstore.io/c/hades-ii/p/NikkelM/Zagreus_Journey/) and [KeepsakePort](https://thunderstore.io/c/hades-ii/p/zannc/KeepsakePort/).

# Shared Keepsake Port
A mod which ports over multiple keepsakes from Hades 1 to Hades 2.<br>
Currently, this mod contains Thanatos, Hermes, Megaera, Persephone, Eurydice, Patroclus and Sisyphus, although to access Hermes, Persephone and Megaera, you will need to install [KeepsakePort](https://thunderstore.io/c/hades-ii/p/zannc/KeepsakePort/) (this mod is automatically installed alongside KeepsakePort).<br>
>[!NOTE]
>The primary function for this mod is to be used as a dependency for [Zagreus' Journey](https://thunderstore.io/c/hades-ii/p/NikkelM/Zagreus_Journey/) and [KeepsakePort](https://thunderstore.io/c/hades-ii/p/zannc/KeepsakePort/), and not to be used standalone.
